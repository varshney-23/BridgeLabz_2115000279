Description:
- Implemented multiple class-based systems (Bank Account, Library Management, Employee Management, Shopping Cart, University Student Management, Vehicle Registration, and Hospital Management).
- Used static variables for shared data (e.g., bank name, library name, company name).
- Employed final fields to ensure immutability (e.g., account number, ISBN, employee ID).
- Utilized this to resolve constructor ambiguities.
- Used instanceof for safe type-checking before displaying object details.
